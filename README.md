# DL_Seismoacoustic_Fusion
The information in this repository outlines how to extract and process the seismic and infrasound data used to train both seismic and seismoacoustic neural networks as introduced in the manuscript, "Deep Multimodal Learning for Seismoacoustic Fusion to Improve Earthquake-Explosion Discrimination within the Korean Peninsula". ObsPy and TensorFlow software packages are used for geophysical and deep learning analyses, respectively.
