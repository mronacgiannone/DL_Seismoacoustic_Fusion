# DL_Seismoacoustic_Fusion
This is the public repository associated with the paper "Deep Multimodal Learning for Seismoacoustic Fusion within the Korean Peninsula". It outlines how to extract and process the seismic and infrasound data used to train both seismic and seismoacoustic neural networks. ObsPy and TensorFlow software packages are used for geophysical and deep learning analyses, respectively.
